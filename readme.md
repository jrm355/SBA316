## tools used: using onling rescources as well as notes, was searching a lot online for quiz game ideas, this is more a base idea
## How to get through answer the questions, you will greeted with questions. If you successfully answer the questions you will be given clues, which will unlock the final page. All the answers should be fairly obvious, I purposely didn't choose difficult questions just to make the grading easier.

This was more of a template to just kind of seeing what was possible, with more time, designing, and planning, I'm sure there's some good idea here. My code is sloppy and and I don't really think I have enough time to clean it.
